"""The damped, driven oscillator and its resonance curve.

A mass on a spring with linear drag and a sinusoidal driving force obeys

    m x'' + b x' + k x = F₀ cos(Ω t).

After the transient has died away, the mass moves at the driving frequency
with the amplitude and phase lag that this module gives in closed form; the
amplitude as a function of Ω is the resonance curve, with its peak near the
natural frequency, its width set by the damping, and the quality factor Q as
the ratio of the two. The full motion from any start, transient included, is
also known in closed form for underdamped motion, so a simulation can be
checked at every instant, and the measured resonance curve can be checked
against the amplitude formula.

This module owns the verified reference solution of the damped driven
oscillator: the course lesson on resonance (M12) and the coding-agent exercise
that builds the same simulation reuse it.

Quantities are in SI units: masses in kg, ``k`` in N/m, ``b`` in kg/s, the
force amplitude in N, angular frequencies in rad/s, amplitudes in m.
