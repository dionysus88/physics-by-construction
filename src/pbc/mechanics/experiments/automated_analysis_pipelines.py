"""The experiment of the lesson "Automated analysis pipelines".

Two pipelines (``pbc.data.pipeline``): a simulated throw swept over the
launch angle with its uncertainty (``pbc.mechanics.analysis``), and the
measured waves of the committed flume sample with their repetitions, window,
and three numerical runs (``pbc.data.flume_analysis``); each ends in a report
checked against its committed expectation. Run it as a program to write the
figures and numbers of the page:
