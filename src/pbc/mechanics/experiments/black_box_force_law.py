"""The experiment of the lesson "Discovering a force law with controlled probes".

A language model probes a black-box central force and submits a law
(``pbc.discovery.force_lab``, run ``black-box``): the replay of the recorded
run, its score recomputed on the held-out settings, the fit of the family to
the agent's own readings, and the baselines without a model. Run it as a
program to write the figure and numbers of the page:

    uv run --locked --no-dev \\
        python -m pbc.mechanics.experiments.black_box_force_law out

The live run, which asks a model and needs its key, is a separate command
behind the optional dependency ``openai``: ``LIVE``, run with
``uv run --locked --no-dev --extra openai python -m pbc.discovery.force_lab
black-box``.
