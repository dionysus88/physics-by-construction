"""The experiment of the lesson "An experimental design agent".

An agent that chooses the readings of a drag experiment
(``pbc.agents.design_lab``): the score of a design, the replay of two
recorded campaigns on a full and on a slow rig, and the judge that decides
between linear and quadratic drag from the recomputed readings. Run it as a
program to write the figure and numbers of the page:

    uv run --locked --no-dev \\
        python -m pbc.mechanics.experiments.experimental_design_agent out

The live run, which asks a model and needs its key, is a separate command
behind the optional dependency ``openai``: the module ``LIVE``, run with
``uv run --locked --no-dev --extra openai python -m pbc.agents.design_lab``.
