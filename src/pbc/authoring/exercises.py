"""Lean exercises: stubs outside the checked library, solutions inside it.

A learner completes an exercise on their own machine: the stub in
``lean/Exercises/<Name>.lean`` states theorems whose proofs are ``sorry``. The
site never runs Lean for them (ADR 011). The checked solution of each stub is a
module of the library, ``PhysicsByConstruction.Exercises.<Name>``, which
``lake build`` compiles and the axiom audit of ``scripts/check-lean.sh`` finds
free of ``sorry``.

This module does two jobs:

* ``python -m pbc.authoring.exercises <lean project>`` is the pairing check that
  ``scripts/check-lean.sh`` runs: every stub has a solution module, both state
  the same theorems with the same statements, the stub still contains
  ``sorry``, and the solution contains none.
* ``lean_stub`` shows a stub on a page, marked "not verified", read from the
  file that the check compiled.
