"""Which built pages differ from the base (ADR 014 decision 3).

A build records the checksum of every file of the site with the build commit
normalised: the commit is the one value every page that shows provenance
carries and that changes with every commit, so two builds of the same sources
at two commits would otherwise differ on every lesson page. A run with a base
compares its own record with the record of the base. The checks of one page
(accessibility, reading without scripts, widths, payload) run for the pages
whose normalised bytes differ, which includes every page of a lesson this run
executed. A page loads the files of the site that are not pages (the style
sheet, the scripts, the fonts, the images) without a checksum in its link, so a
difference in any of them, a file the base does not have, or a file the base
has and the site lacks, selects every page; it selects no lesson for execution,
which only the digests of the lessons decide (``pbc.authoring.selection``).

The checks of one page write what they ran for, and why, to
``CHECKED_FILE``: the record of the checked pages of the run.

The record of a base is data; nothing in it is executed or read as
configuration, and a record that cannot be read selects every page.
