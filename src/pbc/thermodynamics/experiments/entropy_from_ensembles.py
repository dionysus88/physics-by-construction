"""The experiment of the lesson "Entropy from ensembles".

The Ehrenfest model of particles hopping between two halves of a box
(``pbc.thermodynamics.entropy``): the counting of microstates, the Gibbs
entropy of an ensemble of boxes against the exact distribution, and the bias
of the estimate from a finite ensemble. Run it as a program to write the
figure and numbers of the page:
